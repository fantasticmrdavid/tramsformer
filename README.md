# Project Tramsformation Blog

Project Tramsformation is a passion project by <a href="https://fantasticmrdavid.com.au" target="_blank">David Li</a>
started during Melbourne's 2020 COVID-19 lockdown. It is the culmination of
years of development fueled by a love for all things transforming and
robotic, and growing up in the wonderful city that is Melbourne.

This blog aims to journal some of the thoughts and ideas driving the development
journey and provide some insight into some of the creative decisions and execution that have
brought it to where it is today.
